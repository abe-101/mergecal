    <h2>About mergecal</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      mergecal is a Django webapp that allows you to merge multiple iCalendar feeds into a single feed. With mergecal, you can easily keep track of events from multiple sources in one place. Simply add your iCalendar feeds to your mergecal account, and then subscribe to the merged feed using your calendar client (e.g. Google Calendar).
    </p>
    <p>
      I created mergecal to solve the problem of having to keep track of multiple iCalendar feeds, which can be time-consuming and confusing. I hope that mergecal will make it easier for you to stay organized and never miss an important event again.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">
      Thank you for using mergecal! I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me with your thoughts.

      Abe was inspired to create mergecal while volunteering at <a href="https://codeandcoffee.org">Code and Coffee</a>, where he saw firsthand the difficulties of keeping track of events from multiple iCalendar feeds.
